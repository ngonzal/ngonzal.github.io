    <h1>Nathan R. Gonzalez</h1>
    <p>Hi, My name is Nathan! I am a PhD student studying physics at the University of California, Davis. 
        I am a member of the <a href="https://rlab.engineering.ucdavis.edu/">Radulaski Lab</a> where I work on topics in quantum optics
        and nanophotonics.</p>
    <p>
        My specific research interests are currently in developing near term analog quantum simulations of interesting physical
        phenomena by leveraging light-matter interactions in cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED) systems.
        I am also interested in the development of in using photonics to bridge the gap between quantum computing and quantum communication.
    </p>
